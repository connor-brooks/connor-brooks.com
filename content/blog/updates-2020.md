title: Updates (2020)
date: 2020-02-05

Happy new year! It has been a year since my last update post, here is what's changed since:

* I have graduated from university with a 1st degree in Creative Computing
* My Devuan ThinkPad T420 has been ditched in favour of a 2015 Macbook Pro
* Ecosim is complete (albeit quite messy) and can be viewed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/connor-brooks/ecosim)
* Unexpectedly [play_stdin.sh](/projects/play_stdin.sh) has become my most popular project
* This website now uses Bootstrap 4 and static HTML. A dynamic CMS using Flask is in the works.

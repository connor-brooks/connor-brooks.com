Wobbler is a multi platform software FM synthesiser written in C++ and OpenGL. It enables quick experimentation with synthesis parameters, in a way that mimics the experience of a hardware synth. In addition to offering a typical GUI, the synth can also be controlled via MIDI and your terminals standard input. This opens up the synth to be easily scripted.

It can be controlled by the user in a number of ways:

* GUI and computer keyboard
* MIDI keyboard
* Scriptable command line interface

Although Wobbler is still under heavy development, most of the core features have been implemented:

* User selectable waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
* Detune
* FM synthesis
* ADSR (Well, attack and release)
* Low pass filter
* LFO for lowpass filter cutoff
* MIDI note input
* Command line parameter and note control

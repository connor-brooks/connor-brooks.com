µCrypt (or muCrypt) is a simple end-to-end encrypted chat. The server is written in Python and the client in JavaScript.

A goal when creating µCrypt was to enable the chat to be audited very easily, because of that the lines of code (minus HTML/CSS) was limited to <200 lines of code in total.

In an attempt to be fully transparent with the user, the client displays a "raw message" bar at the top, enabling the user to monitor exactly what data is being sent to/from the chat.

µCrypt is intended to act as a decentralised chat platform, with users setting up their own servers for their own use, however, a demo is provided below.
